<h6> Primarily frozen locker storage, Foss Locker Plant was started in 1939 by father and son, Mel and Gerry Foss.  The business grew, and in 1960, the plant was sold to Bill Thurston and two other long time employees, Jerry and Dick Laxton.  The three, known as LLT, ran the plant for the next 40 years, butchering and processing beef, pork, and venison.  They also held the recipe for the same great hot dogs and ring bologna we make today!<h6>
<h6> In 1999, Bill, Jerry, and Dick sold the business to long-time local cattleman, Wayne Selbrede. Dick retired, but Bill and Jerry stayed on for years to come, sharing their knowledge and experience with the next generation of loyal employees and customers.</h6>
<h6>In 2013, Foss Fine Meats, as it has come to be known, came under new ownership and management once again.  With the same hard-working commitment that started the business all those years ago, Travis Brooks and Mark Wells strive to offer the same great service and quality that Foss's loyal customers have come to expect.</h6>
